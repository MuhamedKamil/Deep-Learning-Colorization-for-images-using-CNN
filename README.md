# Deep Learning image colorization based on Convolution neural network model 
We build a model for the colorization of grayscale images by fusing both global and local information. Our approach is based on convolutional neural networks and is able to perform the colorization without any user intervention but because of high computation of this model we train the model on one category (landscape images)

# TODO :
* Implement videos colorization 
* Train the model on various of categories
